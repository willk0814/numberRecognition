# Hand Written Number Recognition with ANN

_Will Koenig_

---
### Description:
In this project I will attempt to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) on a data set containing handwritten digits 0-9 and test it's ability to accurately predict what digit it is given.

### Set Up and Run Instructions:

In order to run this project you are going to need to have a few languages and libraries installed.

For this project we will be using the following python libraries:
* gzip
* struct
* os
* numpy - useful for storing and manipulating our data

`pip3 install numpy`

* matplotlib - useful for displaying images of our data as well graphs of our model performance

`pip3 install matplotlib`

### A Hard-Coded Neural Network?
You might have noticed above that I did not important anything to construct the neural network with (tensorflow, keras, pytorch, etc...).  For this project I have hard-coded the structure of the neural network, the activation functions, as well as the feed-forward and back-propagation methods

#### Network Architecture

#### Activation Function

#### Feed-Forward

#### Back-Propagation
